Or use the live server:

```bash
# From project root
cd templates/componentized
python -m http.server 8080
# Then open http://localhost:8080/end3-complete.html
```

## Integration

These templates are designed to be:
- **Standalone**: Can run independently
- **Embeddable**: Can be loaded in iframes
- **Portable**: All dependencies from CDN
- **Self-documenting**: Complete with inline comments

## Dependencies

All scenes use CDN resources:
- THREE.js (r160) - 3D rendering
- THREE.js addons - Post-processing effects
- Google Fonts - Typography
- Twemoji - Emoji rendering
- ES Module Shims - Import map support

## Development

To modify a scene:
1. Open the HTML file in your editor
2. Scene logic is contained within `<script>` tags
3. Styles are in `<style>` tags or inline
4. Test in browser with dev tools open
